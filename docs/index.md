# Movesense TeamNL
TeamNL wants to measure player performance during training sessisons to improve it. By using the Movesense sensore they can collect data about the movement and heartrate of the players. But there is no way to view this data in a comprehensive way unless given to data scientist. Therefore, we want to create an app that can fill the language gab between the datascientists and the trainers, by translating datasets into words. With the app, trainers can, in real-time, see the perfomance of the players and adjust accordingly on the fly.

The trainers can create training sessions where they can monitor the performance of the players that are training. At the start, a trainer can select exactly what kind of data it wants to see per player. For example if it just wants to see how many jumps a player makes or what the heart rate is during the training.

The slection of variables measured is created by datascientists. They can make scripts in Python or R to synthesize the data collected from the Movesense. The scripts are saved on a database so that the app can access them and show the synthesized data.
