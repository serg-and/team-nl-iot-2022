# Algemenen planning


On Mondays we meet with our coach Bas. When we don't have obligations at school we work from home. Every day we have a daily-standup at 10:00. both online and at school. On Thursdays we have the product review with the client at 14:00. On Thursday morning we make sure we are prepared for the product review by having a working product. If we find before Thursday that it is too much work to do on the day, this will be waived.
