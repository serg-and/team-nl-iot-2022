# Supabase (Database)
The mobile app and web application uses a Supabase database. Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. Start your project with a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, and Storage.<br>

Supabase was chosen because of the following reasons:

 - Supports realtime features, important for show data during sessions in realtime
 - Has support for Flutter and Nextjs (frameworks used in this project)
 - Easy authentication integration
 - Automatad API documentation
 - Can be run both in the cloud and locally/self hosted

The last feature is esspecially important because one of the requirements of Team-NL is that they want to self host their infrastructure.<br>

The database will be ran in the cloud during the development phase, because this makes development faster and easeier.
