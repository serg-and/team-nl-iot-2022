# Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It uses the
Dart programming language and allows developers to create web, desktop and cross-platform apps that
run on Android and IOS devices from a single codebase. Flutter is known for its fast development
cycle, fast performance, and attractive user interface. It is a powerful framework for building
beautiful and high-performance apps for both IOS and Android.

# Why are we using Flutter for our app?

There are several reasons why we choose to use Flutter for our project, and I am going to list the main reasons below.

-	**Increased productivity.** Using the same codebase for iOS and Android saves both time and resources. Flutter’s native widgets also minimize time spent on testing by ensuring there is little to no compatibility issues with different OS versions.

-	**Easy to learn.** Flutter allows developers to build native mobile applications without needing to access OEM widgets or use a lot of code. This, in addition to Flutter’s particularly appealing user interface, makes the mobile app creation process much simpler.

-	**Great performance.** Users report that it is difficult to notice the difference between a Flutter app and a native mobile app.

-	**Cost-effective.** Building iOS and Android apps with the same codebase is essentially building two apps for the price of one.
