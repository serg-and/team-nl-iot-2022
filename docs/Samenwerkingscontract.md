## Git

A separate brench will be created for each isue. You can push and commit on it without control. Merge with the main brench is only allowed on the gitlab website. Here you create a merge request and it must be approved by another team member by meeting the definition of done. If there are problems with an isue it should be mentioned during the daily stand up.
