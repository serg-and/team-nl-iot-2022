|Splash screen|A splash screen is a graphical user interface element that is typically used to provide visual feedback to the user while the app is loading. This can help to improve the user experience by giving the user something to look at while they are waiting for the app to become responsive. In some cases, a splash screen may also display branding or logo information for the app, or provide a brief overview of the app's features. Ultimately, the use of a splash screen is a matter of design preference, and it can be a useful tool for engaging the user and setting the tone for the app.|![Splash Screen](images/features_page/SplashScreen.jpg)|

|Bluetooth Low Energy|Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE, is a wireless technology that is designed to provide low-power communication between devices. It is a variant of the Bluetooth standard, and is often used in devices such as fitness trackers, smartwatches, and other wearable technology, as well as in home automation and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. BLE is designed to consume less power than regular Bluetooth, which makes it well-suited for applications where the device needs to operate for long periods of time on a small battery like the movesense sensor that we have. With this feature you can turn bluetooth on, discover for bluetooth devices and connect with bluetooth devices.|![Turn bluetooth on](images/features_page/TurnOnBluetoothpage.jpg)![Permission](images/features_page/bluetoothPermissionMessage.jpg)![Discovering](images/features_page/DiscoveringBluetoothDevices.jpg)![Connecting](images/features_page/ConnectingBluetoothDevice.jpg)![Connected](images/features_page/ConnectedBluetoothDevices.jpg)|
|Start session|On the current page, the user can visualize the up-loaded script. The user is presented with an overview of all the scripts with a corresponding description. On the right side of the screen is the select buttons. This allows the user to select which scripts should be visualized. At the top right there is a button that redirects the user to the sensor page. Here the user can choose which sensor to use. If all choices are selected then the user can click on the start session button, to start the session. The user is then redirected to the heartbeat page, where the data can be read in the graphs.  
|Heartbeat charts|By clicking on the start session button the user can start a session and see the chats created for the session. A heart rate chart is a graph that shows the heart rate over a period of time. It is often used to monitor the heart rate of a person and detect any abnormalities. The heart rate is measured in beats per minute and can be determined by counting the number of times the heart beats in one minute. The data used in the charts is retrieved from the server.|![Session start](images/features_page/SessionStart.jpg)![Graph](images/features_page/HeartBeatChart.jpg)|
