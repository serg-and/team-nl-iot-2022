|Splash screen|A splash screen is a graphical user interface element that is typically used to provide visual feedback to the user while the app is loading. This can help to improve the user experience by giving the user something to look at while they are waiting for the app to become responsive. In some cases, a splash screen may also display branding or logo information for the app, or provide a brief overview of the app's features. Ultimately, the use of a splash screen is a matter of design preference, and it can be a useful tool for engaging the user and setting the tone for the app.|photo|
